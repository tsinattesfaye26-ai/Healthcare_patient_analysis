## Q1 What is the age distribution of patients
Age_groupm |	patient_count |	percentage
|----------|-------------|----------|
0-17 (Minor)	| 703	| 2.04
18-35 (Young Adult)	| 6614	| 19.21
36-55 (Middle-Aged) |	13554 |	39.37
56-75 (Senior) |	10720	 | 31.14
76+ (Elderly) |	2839	| 8.25

**Insights**
Middle-aged adults (36–55) represent the largest patient group
Senior patients (56–75) account for nearly one-third of total cases
Minors form a very small share of the patient population
Healthcare demand is concentrated in working-age and older adults

- Obesity and diabetes consistently rank highest across all age groups
- Disease frequency increases with age, peaking in middle-aged and senior groups
- Minors show significantly lower condition counts compared to adults
- Chronic conditions dominate older age groups, indicating age-driven health risks

## Q3 Are there gender differences in admission rates?

Gender	| total_admissions |	percentage_of_total
Female	| 16985 |	49.33
Male	| 17445	| 50.67

-- Top 3 conditions for each gender
Gender |  medical_Condition | frequency
|------|--------------------|----------|
Female | Diabetes      | 2,900
Female | Asthma       | 2,875
Female | Hypertension | 2,833
Female | Arthritis    | 2,820
Female | Obesity      | 2,814

Male   | Arthritis    | 2,851
Male   | Asthma       | 2,820

- Obesity and diabetes are the most common conditions across both genders
- Males show higher obesity frequency than females
- Female condition counts are more evenly distributed
- Chronic diseases dominate regardless of gender
